00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Once upon a time, there was a small village in the mountains.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In that village lived a wise old man.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
One day, a young man came to visit the elder.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
"Please teach me the wisdom of life."

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The old man smiled and pointed to the mountain.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
"Climb that mountain, and you will find your answer."

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The young man began climbing the treacherous path.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Finally reaching the summit, he found enlightenment.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
"The journey itself was the lesson!"

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
He returned to the village and shared his story.
