        By using the service through in-app purchases, you agree to the collection and use of your personal data in accordance with this policy.

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
        When using the service through in-app purchases, you may be required to provide certain personally identifiable information, such as your email and name, 
        to ensure a better user experience. This is necessary when using Google Storage.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Data Permission and Usage</h2>
    <p>
        You may be asked to grant permission to access your Google email address and profile name. 
        By allowing this, you agree to let the add-on access your email and name. 
        The primary purpose of collecting email and name is to create and authenticate user accounts and manage them. 
        Your email and name will not be stored, shared, or used for any other purpose, in compliance with Google's Limited Use Policy.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
        The security of your data is important to us. While we use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal data, absolute security cannot be guaranteed. 
        Documents are not stored after translation.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Service Providers</h2>
    <p>
        We may employ third-party companies to support translation functionalities. 
        These third parties are only allowed to access personal information to perform specific tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Log Data</h2>
    <p>
